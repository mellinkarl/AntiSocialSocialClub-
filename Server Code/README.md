We based our app project off of the node js starter app provided and then adapted it to our own needs and structure. We also used the delete method very closely (AJAX Method), utilizing different files as instructed in the starter app to make the file structure easier. The last thing we used from the node starter app was the structure of the tables and the forms for inspiration in our own project. We did not follow to the 'T', and made our own adjustments with divs for formatting and assigned classes/IDs for styling purposes.

We created the index.js file from scratch, as well as the handlebars files (with the exception of the aforementioned portions), and the style.css sheet was our own original work.

We received some guidance from the TA James Cole with the update functionality, created something similar and came to the conclusion it was easier to perform all functionalities but the delete in this manner.
